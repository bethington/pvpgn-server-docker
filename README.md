## üßê About <a name = "about"></a>

Yet another [pvpgn-docker](https://github.com/search?q=pvpgn-docker) project. Aims to be:

- ‚åõ time-proof, by pulling the latest code from PvPGN-PRO repo
- üîê secure, by using non-privileged user and group to run the server
- üóú small, by using alpine linux instead of ubuntu
- ‚öñ lightweight, by using multi-target building to keep only the needed content on the final image

## üèÅ Getting Started <a name = "getting_started"></a>

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes. See [deployment](#deployment) for notes on how to deploy the project on a live system.

### Prerequisites

You'll need docker at least [docker](https://docs.docker.com/install/) to run the base image, and [docker-compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/) to run the full-blown server.

### Installing

Pull the image from Docker Hub:

```sh
docker pull wwmoraes/pvpgn-server
```

Then run:
```sh
docker run --rm -it pvpgn-server:latest # or make run
```

## üéà Usage <a name="usage"></a>

The image exposes the ports 6112 (Battle.net server) and 4000 (game server). You should be able to connect your game through the host IP.

For detailed info about it read through the [PvPGN-PRO](https://pvpgn.pro/) docs:
